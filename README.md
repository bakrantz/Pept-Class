Here, we present a supervised deep learning data processing pipeline for peptide classification from nanopore translocation events. The first stage employs a convolutional and recurrent neural network, adapted from the Deep-Channel multi-channel classifier, to accurately classify raw current recordings into discrete conductance states, including partially blocked sub-conductance intermediates. The second stage, peptide classification, utilizes a novel branched input network with a temporal convolutional network for processing translocation event conductance state sequences and a dense network for incorporating computed event-level and global kinetic features. This code was developed based on real datasets and simulated datasets, which are all provided.
